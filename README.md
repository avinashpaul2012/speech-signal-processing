# speech-signal-processing
processing of recorded and speech data-sets using machine learning techniques

The project involves processing of speech signals using machine learning techniques.
First segmentation of speech is done to find speech and non-speech regions.
Next the voiced and unvoiced regions are found using energy comparison. 
Pitch frequency of a speech signal is found using the autocorrelation function. 
The pitch frequency and format frequencies of a speech signal can also be derived from Linear Prediction (LP) magnitude spectrum.
